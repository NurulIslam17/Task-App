## About

This is a simple STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM where there are 3 types of users based on their role. These are ADMIN, TEACHER, and STUDENT. Student can register themselves to the system to enroll in the offered course. All users can perform only these actions, which are allowed based on their role. After successfully completing the registration, a user can get the confirmation email. And there is a scheduled notification system for the alert notification of how many pending students are available in the system. This notification only gets to the super admin at a specific time based on the scheduled time.
